# Car-price-features-prediction-in-US-market

## Overview

This project aims to model car prices in the American market using various regression algorithms. The goal is to identify significant factors influencing car prices and develop a predictive model that can help a Chinese automobile company understand the pricing dynamics as they enter the US market. The project includes data preprocessing, model implementation, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and visualization of results.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available at: [Car Price Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FHmYNLs9v0Enc-UExEMpitOFGsWvB2dP/view?usp=drive_link)

It contains various features related to car specifications and attributes, along with their corresponding prices.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following key components:

1. **Loading and Preprocessing:** Loading the dataset and performing necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. **Model Implementation:** Implementing and training five regression algorithms:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor
   - Support Vector Regressor
3. **Model Evaluation:** Comparing the performance of all the models based on R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Identifying the best-performing model and justifying the selection.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Performing hyperparameter tuning on the best-performing model to potentially improve its performance.
5. **Feature Importance Analysis:** Identifying the significant variables affecting car prices.
6. **Visualization:** Visualizing model performance, feature importance, and outlier detection.
